Web Application Developer

I love understanding people’s problems and finding ways to solve them, which is why I’ve been building web applications like floatapp.com and talky.io for 8 years.

I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring empathy and strong communication to teams, and strive to learn and teach as much as I can.
